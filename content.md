# Introduction to GitHub Project Boards

## Purpose of Kanban Boards

Kanban boards are visual tools that help manage workflow efficiently. They use cards and columns to represent tasks and their stages of progress. The main benefits of Kanban boards include:

1. **Visualization**: Makes it easy to see the status of work items.
2. **Workflow Management**: Helps manage tasks from start to finish.
3. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**: Encourages teams to focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Provides a visual representation of bottlenecks and inefficiencies, allowing teams to improve processes continuously.

## GitHub Project Boards

GitHub Project Boards bring the power of Kanban boards into the realm of software development. They offer a flexible way to organize and prioritize your work. Here’s how you can use GitHub Project Boards to manage your projects:

### Creating a Project Board

1. Navigate to the main page of your repository.
2. Click on the **Projects** tab.
3. Click **New Project**.
4. Choose a template (**Kanban**, **Team planning**, etc.) and name your project.

### Adding Columns

1. Click **+** to the right of the columns.
2. Name your column (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
3. Repeat for additional columns.

### Adding Items

- Items represent tasks and can be added to columns.
- Click on **+ Add item** at the bottom of a column to create a new item.

## Linking Issues to the Project Board

Issues can be linked to project boards to track work items. Here's how to do it:

### Directly from the Issue

1. Navigate to an issue within your repository.
2. On the right-hand side, look for the **Projects** section.
3. Click the wheel icon and select the desired project(s).
4. You can change the status and additional information from this view as well.

### From the Project Board

1. Go to your project board.
2. Click on **+ Add item**.
3. In the **+ Add item** dialog, you can search for the repository and the existing issues to add.

## Linking Pull Requests to the Project Board

Just like issues, pull requests can also be linked to project boards:

### Directly from the Pull Request

1. Navigate to a pull request within your repository.
2. On the right-hand side, look for the **Projects** section.
3. Click the wheel icon and select the desired project and column.

### From the Project Board

1. Go to your project board.
2. Click on **+ Add item**.
3. In the "+ Add item" dialog, you can search for the repository and the existing pull requests to add.

## Practical Example

Let’s go through a practical example to understand how to set up and use a GitHub Project Board:

### Creating a Project

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Projects** tab.
3. Click **New project**, name it "Development Workflow", and choose the **Kanban** template.

### Adding Columns

- You will have three default columns: "To do", "In progress", and "Done".
- You can add more columns if needed by clicking "+" to the right of the columns.

### Creating and Linking Issues

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository.
2. Create a new issue, for example, "Set up development environment".
3. In the issue, link it to your project by clicking the wheel icon in the **Projects** section, filter projects and search for the project you would like to link, and change the status.

### Moving Issues Across Columns

- As you start working on the task, move the issue from "To do" to "In progress".
- Once the task is completed, move it to the "Done" column.

### Linking Pull Requests

1. When you create a pull request for the issue, link it to your project board in the same way.
2. This helps in tracking the progress of your code review and merge process.

## This is Just the Beginning
